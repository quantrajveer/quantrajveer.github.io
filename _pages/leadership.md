## Selected Comments from Students on My Classroom Teaching at UC Riverside

- "The instructor was overall very kind with grading. I really liked how the class is based on programming in R using data analysis. This is great because the market is full of these types of roles, and he is pretty much helping us obtain skills used in the real world. I would recommend him to other students if he were a TA. Thank you for reading."

- "The instructor was not only effective in teaching material that was directly applicable to the course but also aided us in acquiring some important skills for the job market as they pertained to the lecture material."

- "I liked how the TA helped clarify concepts covered in class and explained the mathematical significance and the reason why we do our economic math in a particular manner. He made sure that we all understood and took time to answer questions and clarify answers. Inclusion of real-world examples and asking for responses from the class to engage in the discussion section helped me learn better. I overall had a great experience with this TA and his patience. Thank you!!"

This TA is the first TA I had so far that actually conducts discussions, unlike other TAs who show up, write on the board, and leave. Thank you, Jat."
